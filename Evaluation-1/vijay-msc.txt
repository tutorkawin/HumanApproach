prg 5:
logic 1:
a[]={1,3,0,5,0,6,0,8}
yur o/p:13560000
expected o/p:1,3,5,6,8,0,0,0

note:	understand the question first and use differnt kind of input to your logic wheather it will work or not.
	you had replaced the value but you need to swap it..
	Anyways you are near to output, Good improvement. 
			keep on going..

logic 2:
	yeah good approach.. also find the logic using comparing and swaping.., 
	if incase you got questions like move the negative numbers to right side.
	at the time you can't you a loop like which u used to store zero.
	for(int i=k;k<a.length;k++)
        {
            a[k]=0;
        }


prg 1:

	you have changed the qn and achieved the output. anyway u got output 
	String str="grampro";
	question is str="program"
	find the logic change the string program to grampro and kawinr to inrkaw.
	and other pattern logic a looking good.
