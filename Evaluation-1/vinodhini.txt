prg 1:
	Awesome everything looks perfect. Your code is good as well. 
	Good thinking ability.
	The best solution for 1st program.
	Great Work.

prg 2:
	Cool all looking perfect. Your code is good as well. 
	Good thinking ability.
	one of the best solution for 2nd program

prg 3:
	Anyways you got output but try to do more efficent.otherwise eery thing is perfect.
	In this case u can improvize your efficient in looping in this program.
	I already said that don't use bulit in function. Don't repeat it again.
	if(Character.isAlphabetic(str.charAt(i)))
	int num=Character.getNumericValue(str.charAt(i));
	think the logic to check the without bulit-in function.

program 4:
	Anyway you got output.
	{{1,2},{3,4},{5,6}} for this input you got array index out of bound. check it.
	very think did correct but except initialation of i,j variable change it.
	other than that Your code is very efficient as well. 
	Good thinking ability. 
	keep on doing..

prg 5:
	i said to move all the zero to right side but you printed the values,
	Think another logic and check it and do it correctly.
	Understand the question and try to do that if any doubts ask me.

		Super keep sloving more problems..
