..gramException in thread "main" java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException: String index out of range: 7at java.base/java.lang.StringLatin1.charAt(StringLatin1.java:47)
at java.base/java.lang.String.charAt(String.java:693)
	at HelloWorld.main(HelloWorld.java:18)

your started well the program but u missed some logic to print the "pro" as well. check and do it.

prg 2:
	Cool all looking perfect. Your code is good as well. 
	Good thinking ability.
	one of the best solution for 2nd program

program 4:
	Anyway you got output.
	{{1,2},{3,4},{5,6}} for this input you got array index out of bound. check it.
	very think did correct but except initialation of i,j variable change it.
	other than that Your code is very efficient as well. 
	Good thinking ability. 
	keep on doing..
