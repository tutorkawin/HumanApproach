prg 2:

prg 1:
	i got this error when i ran your code
......
.....i
....in
...inr..inrException in thread "main" java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException: String index out of range: 6
at java.base/java.lang.StringLatin1.charAt(StringLatin1.java:47)
at java.base/java.lang.String.charAt(String.java:693)
	at HelloWorld.main(HelloWorld.java:19)

	your started well the program but u missed some logic to print the "pro" as well. check and do it.



		For your second submission code looks similar to vinodhini.
		I'm not offending you, if you don't know or not understood the logic means you can ask yours frnds and then
		try to do that yourself from what they have exxplained you or ask me i will help you to how to do this.
