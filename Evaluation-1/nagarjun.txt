prg 1:
	Cool all looking good. Your code is very efficient as well. 
	Good thinking ability.
	i have already said that dont declear the value instead use some opertion to to find the answer
	your code should work for the all kind of input.
	String s="kawinr";
		int x=3;
		int y=0;
	again don't repeat this.

prg 2:
	Cool all looking perfect. Your code is good as well. 
	Good thinking ability.
	no need to give = , when you starts i as 0.
	for(int i=0;i<=s.length();i++)

prg 3:
	In this case u can improvize your efficient in looping in this program.
	I already said that don't use bulit in function. Don't repeat it again.
	if(Character.isLetter(s.charAt(i)) && Character.isDigit(s.charAt(i+1)))
	think the logic to check the without bulit-in function.

prg 4:
	All looking good. but {{1,2},{3,4},{5,6}} for this input you got array index out of bound. check it.

prg 5:
	yeah good approach.. also find the logic using comparing and swaping.., 
	if incase you got questions like move the negative numbers to right side.
	at the time you can't you a loop like which u used to store zero.
	 while(count< n)
	{
		a[count]=0;
		count++;
	}

kindly do proper intendation also..
