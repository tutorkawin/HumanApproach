program 4:
	Anyway you got output.
	{{1,2},{3,4},{5,6}} for this input you got array index out of bound. check it.
	very think did correct but except initialation of i,j variable change it.
	other than that Your code is very efficient as well. 
	Good thinking ability. 
	keep on doing..

program 5:
	yeah good approach.. also find the logic using comparing and swaping.., 
	if incase you got questions like move the negative numbers to right side.
	at the time you can't you a loop like which u used to store zero.
	 while (c<n)
      		a[c++] = 0;

Do attempt more programs.
